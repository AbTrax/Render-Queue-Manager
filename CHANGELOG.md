# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.14.0] - 2025-10-03

### Added

- Per-job and per-output encoding controls (color depth, compression, EXR codec, JPEG quality) with UI configuration.

### Changed

- Main render output now prefixes filenames with the job name so files in subfolders and multiview variants are job-scoped by default.

### Fixed

- View layer selections stay in sync per job when scenes change or layers are renamed.

## [1.13.5] - 2025-09-26

### Improved (Reload & Registration)

- Hot-reload stability during development: safely reloads submodules without crashing on errors.
- More robust class registration/unregistration to avoid duplicates when reloading the add-on.
- Handler lifecycle tightened to prevent lingering handlers across enable/disable cycles.

### Fixed (Unregister)

- Safer pointer cleanup on unregister to avoid rare AttributeError cases.

## [1.13.0] - 2025-09-12

### Added

- Per-job view layer selection with UI picker and render-time enforcement.
